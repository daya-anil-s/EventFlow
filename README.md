##  What is EventFlow?

**EventFlow** is an open-source, modular web platform that provides complete digital infrastructure to run hackathons, open-source programs, and community tech events.

It replaces scattered tools like **Google Forms, Sheets, emails, and chats** with **one unified system**.

---

## Problem Statement

Most tech events rely on:

- Disconnected tools  
- Manual tracking  
- Error-prone spreadsheets  
- No reusable infrastructure  

This results in confusion, inconsistent evaluation, and a poor participant experience.

EventFlow addresses these challenges by providing a reusable, modular event infrastructure engine.

## Health Check

### GET /health

Returns backend server status.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true
}

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm or npm
- MongoDB

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R3ACTR/EventFlow.git
   cd EventFlow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Copy the example env file and update it with your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

Visit: http://localhost:3000
## Default Ports

During local development, the project uses the following default ports:

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:5000

This distinction helps ensure frontend applications are configured to communicate with the correct backend service.
## API Base URL

During local development, the backend API is accessible at:


## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run the project correctly.
Ensure they are defined before starting the application.

| Variable Name   | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| DATABASE_URL    | MongoDB connection string |
| NEXTAUTH_URL    | Authentication callback URL |

### Notes
- These variables should be set in your environment configuration file.
- Restart the development server after updating environment variables.
## Common Issues & Fixes

This section helps contributors quickly resolve frequent setup and runtime problems.

### App Not Starting

**Possible Causes**
- Missing or incorrect `.env` configuration
- Dependencies not installed

**Fix**
- Ensure `.env.local` exists and contains required variables
- Run `pnpm install` before starting the server
- Restart the dev server after environment changes

---

### Auth Callback URL Misconfiguration

**Problem**
Authentication fails or redirects incorrectly during login.

**Fix**
- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is correctly set in `.env.local`
- Example:
  ```env
  NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000S

## Architecture

```
├── app/
│   ├── (auth)/          # Authentication routes (Login, Register)
│   ├── (dashboard)/     # Role-based dashboards (Admin, Participant, Judge)
│   ├── api/             # Backend API routes
│   └── layout.js        # Root layout & providers
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── models/              # Mongoose database models
├── lib/                 # Utility functions & DB connection
└── public/              # Static assets
```

Built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MongoDB**. The project uses a modular folder structure to separate concerns between auth, dashboards, and API logic.
The app directory follows the Next.js 14 App Router architecture.

The models directory contains Mongoose schemas defining database structure.

Modular, role-based, and reusable by design.

Utility functions, database connection logic, and shared helpers
